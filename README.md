# Determining Galaxy Redshift Using Spectral Line Fitting

## ðŸŒŒOverview
This project aims to determine the redshift (z) of a galaxy by analyzing its observed spectrum. By identifying spectral features (such as emission or absorption lines) and fitting a model to these features, we can compare their observed wavelengths to their known rest-frame wavelengths. This comparison allows us to calculate the redshift, which provides insights into the galaxy's velocity and distance due to the expansion of the universe.
