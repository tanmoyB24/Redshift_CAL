# Redshift_CAL
By identifying spectral features (such as emission or absorption lines) and fitting a model to these features, we can compare their observed wavelengths to their known rest-frame wavelengths. This comparison allows us to calculate the redshift, which provides insights into the galaxy's velocity and distance due to the expansion of the universe.
